There is only one code file in this project:
    1. experiments.ipynb

To run the code, simply clone the GitHub directory into a folder on your local machine and execute the cell in the Jupyter notebook.
The plots should be outputted into the plots/ folder automatically, as the code reads the current working directory using the "os"
library.
