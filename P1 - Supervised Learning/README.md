There are three code files in this project:
    1. models-bm.ipynb
    2. models-ie.ipynb
    3. helpers.py

The files 1 and 2 are identical, except that one was used to run the experiments on the Bank Marketing dataset and the other
for the Income Evaluation. The reason behind duplicating the file was to keep the cell outputs and plots for each individual dataset separate from each other.

Instruction for running the code:
    Simply execute the cells the in the order given and everything should run just fine. The code files are in the correct directory to interact with the data folder with no errors. Make sure the modules listed in the first cell of the notebook are all installed on your machine.
