To run the code, simply clone the GitHub directory into a folder on your local machine and execute the cells
in the FrozenLake-experiments.ipynb Jupyter notebook.
The plots should be outputted into the plots/ folder automatically, as the code reads the current working
directory using the "os" library.

Files in this project:
    1. FrozenLake-experiments.ipynb : the driver code to run the experiments
    2. Agent.py : Agent class that defines PI and VI functions for the algorithms
    3. MarkovDecisionProcess.py : MarkovDecisionProcess class that defines the environment for a MDP.
